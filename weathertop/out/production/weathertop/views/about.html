        <p>
          Welcome to our website! Weather top is a Web Application to accompany the Weather Top 1000. A modular weather station that allows amateur and professional whether enthusiasts alike
          to record and upload data from their own automatic weather station to a free-to-use (and ad-free!) website. As this is a community lead project the
          observations are from different sources, As such the quality varies from source to source and the data is not reviewed or corrected.
          Data may be missing from time to time and occasional spikes may occur but you, the early adopter can help make this the most accurate weather app in Ireland and someday the world.
